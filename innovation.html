    <section class="post-content post-shaper">
        <p class="post-message">On a small farm of less than five acres, the Assime family grows sorghum, rice, peppers and okra, and keeps a brood of chickens. The family eats part of the crops they harvest and some they sell. Like other farming families in the Upper East Region of Ghana, they work the fields themselves, but also sometimes hire labor to help.

            What sets the Assime family apart is that come October, when the rains end and the dry season sets in, their farm will stand out as an island of green, while other fields around them turn yellow and bare.
            
            A closer look at the Assime farm reveals why: at the center of their farm, near their house, solar panels and a solar-powered irrigation pump have been installed. The pump has enabled the family to overcome increasing and lengthy dry spells and to keep on growing crops past the end of the rainy season and throughout the dry season.
            
            As the Assimes have found, solar-powered irrigation is enabling farmers in sub-Saharan Africa to adapt to a changing climate. It bypasses many of the infrastructure and energy constraints that rural farmers face and offer a relatively affordable way for farmers to boost their climate resilience. That’s why the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (ILSSI) is conducting research with a wide variety of partners to pinpoint where and how even more smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa can enjoy the benefits of solar-powered irrigation.</p>
        <p class="post-message">Mrs. Assime then showed me another piece of land cleared recently where she will grow kenaf alongside the vegetables. She also mentioned how she now has more time available since she no longer needs to walk 2 kilometers to collect water for the household, chickens and crops.

            Expanding farmers’ access to solar-powered pumps has been relatively slow in sub-Saharan Africa, but research supported by Feed the Future is enabling knowledge partnerships across sectors and regions to accelerate the process. Equally important, the research results are providing a better understanding of the policies and initiatives needed to ensure that even more farmers like the Assimes can cope with climate change impacts.</p>
