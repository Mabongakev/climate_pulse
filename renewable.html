        <p class="post-message">Morocco is leading the continent’s charge into wind energy, paving the way for a green energy transition that is creating jobs and reducing carbon footprints, according to a new report from the Global Wind Energy Council.

            At the close of 2020, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that 6.5 GW of wind energy had been installed across Africa. 
            
            Morocco, with its ambitious renewable energy programs, has played a pivotal role in this growth. The identified installed capacity, including operational and under-construction projects scheduled for commissioning in 2023, now stands at a staggering 9 GW, the report shows.</p>
        <p class="post-message">Fueled by a state vision, Morocco’s wind energy continues to expand. The Koudia Al Baida wind farm, on the outskirts of Tangier, is set to expand from 54 MW to 120 MW and eventually to an impressive 200 MW. 

            The positive momentum is also due to the engagement of private-sector operators. Industries in Morocco are increasingly taking charge of their energy needs by installing their wind farms, as they attempt to keep up with the green energy transition. 
            
            Key sectors such as cement and fertilizer production have embraced wind energy to power their operations. Major companies like OCP Group, LafargeHolcim, and Cimat are among those leading the way in this initiative.
            
            Siemens Gamesa, a prominent player in the wind energy industry, established a blade manufacturing facility in Morocco to supply wind turbines to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. 
            
            
            Although this facility was discontinued in 2022 for commercial reasons, it underscores the country's strategic location and its potential as a wind energy hub. </p>
