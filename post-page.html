        <p class="post-message">The G7 Summit is a crucial moment to hold these major polluters accountable for their role in the climate crisis. The G7 countries are responsible for 25% of global CO2 emissions, yet they have failed to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion in climate finance to developing countries. This is unacceptable. We need to see real action from the G7 leaders to address the climate crisis and support those most affected by it.</p>
        <p class="post-message">“The G7 leaders, who will soon be in Italy for their summit, need to understand that while they are debating, about 370 million people in southern Africa are at risk from climate change-related hazards such as cyclones, droughts, and floods among others, and their lives will either improve or worsen depending on their funding priorities. They have to treat the demands of Africa seriously.” – Sherpard Zvigadza, Southern Africa Region Climate Action Network (SARCAN)</p>
        <p class="post-message">“The G7 are among the world’s most powerful and wealthiest nations. At this summit, they have a responsibility to lead the way on phasing out fossil fuels at home and abroad. There is no shortage of public money to make the COP28 decision on fossil fuels a reality – it is just poorly distributed to the most harmful parts of our economies that are driving the climate crisis and extreme inequalities. G7 countries must commit to submitting enhanced climate plans under the Paris Agreement that will deliver a science-aligned fossil fuel phaseout and keep their promise to stop funding fossil fuels.” – Adam McGibbon, Public Finance Strategist at Oil Change International 

            “The quantity and quality of climate finance available to date to combat the intensifying climate crisis has been woefully inadequate. This desperately needs to change to keep global warming to within 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. With each increment of global warming, the needs of people on the frontline of this crisis will multiply, and the harms and costs will escalate. We call on the G7 – among the highest income states in the world – to urgently scale up human rights consistent climate finance. More funding must be made available to those who need it most, and provided as grants rather than loans to avoid increasing the debt of lower-income states least responsible for causing climate change.” – Ann Harrison, Climate Justice Adviser, Amnesty International</p>
            <p class="post-message">“If G7 countries want to keep priding themselves on being “world leaders”, they must act as such. The G7 represents the world’s richest and most polluting economies, it is their responsibility to lead on publicly financing a fair renewable energy transition in the Global South. Failure to do so, as we watch countries suffer the impacts of the climate crisis, is an affront to our future. They must end this meeting with a real offer on the table indicating G7 member states willingness to deliver on public finance at COP29.” – Andreas Sieber, Associate Director of Policy and Campaigns, 350.org</p>
